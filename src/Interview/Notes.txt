-Basic O-notation cost analysis of algorithms and solutions.
-Knowledge of basic data structures and their algorithms like working with 
    * strings 99
    * lists 92 96
    * binary trees 111
    * basic graph algorithms (search)
    * basic sorting.
-Ability to understand and analyze problems, identify the right basic data structures and algorithms in them.

- Concepts and Algorithms - While I don’t think most of these are good interview questions (some Bit Manipulation questions are rather ugly), 
it is worth going through them all to ensure yourself you understand basic concepts and some “known” tricks (e.g. in Brain Teasers).

Big O(49)

sum of 1 to n = n(n+1)/2
sum of 1 to n-1 = n(n-1)/2
sum of 2^n(power of 2) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 2^(n+1)-1

O(log n), O(n) , O(n log n) , O(n^2) , O(2^x) , O(n!)

Tree and graphs (111)

-Tree is a type of graph
-Tree
    * Has one root node
    * Root node has zero or more than one child nodes
    * Each child node has zero or more nodes
-Binary tree: tree where every node has max 2 children
-Binary search tree MUST respect rule "all left descendant nodes <= currentNode < all right descendant nodes"
-Balanced tree is a tree where INSERT and FIND complexity is O(log n) or not terribly imbalanced
-Binary tree types
    * COMPLETE binary tree is a tree where all every level is fully filled or except for last level(if we've at least left node present)
      "fully filled" mean left from right.
    * FULL BINARY tree is tree where every node has zero o two children
    * A PERFECT BINARY tree is a complete and full tree with all leaf node on the same level and last level has maximum number of nodes, 
      2^k-1 nodes where k is number of levels
