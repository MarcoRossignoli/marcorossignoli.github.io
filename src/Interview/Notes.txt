-Basic O-notation cost analysis of algorithms and solutions.
-Knowledge of basic data structures and their algorithms like working with 
    * strings 99
    * lists 92 96
    * binary trees 111
    * basic graph algorithms (search)
    * basic sorting.
-Ability to understand and analyze problems, identify the right basic data structures and algorithms in them.

- Concepts and Algorithms - While I don’t think most of these are good interview questions (some Bit Manipulation questions are rather ugly), 
it is worth going through them all to ensure yourself you understand basic concepts and some “known” tricks (e.g. in Brain Teasers).

Big O(49)

sum of 1 to n = n(n+1)/2
sum of 1 to n-1 = n(n-1)/2
sum of 2^n(power of 2) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 2^(n+1)-1

O(log n), O(n) , O(n log n) , O(n^2) , O(2^x) , O(n!)

Tree and graphs (111)

-Tree is a type of graph, tree is a connected graph without cycles.
-Tree
    * Has one root node
    * Root node has zero or more than one child nodes
    * Each child node has zero or more nodes
-Binary tree: tree where every node has max 2 children
-Binary search tree MUST respect rule "all left descendant nodes <= currentNode < all right descendant nodes"
-Balanced tree is a tree where INSERT and FIND complexity is O(log n) or not terribly imbalanced
-Binary tree types
    * COMPLETE binary tree is a tree where all every level is fully filled or except for last level(if we've at least left node present)
      "fully filled" mean left from right.
    * FULL BINARY tree is tree where every node has zero o two children
    * A PERFECT BINARY tree is a complete and full tree with all leaf node on the same level and last level has maximum number of nodes, 
      2^k-1 nodes where k is number of levels
-Binary heaps(min heap, max heap): COMPLETE BINARY TREE where EVERY NODE IS SMALLER THAN CHILDREN, root is the minimum
    * Insert: insert to botton and swap(to top) node until we find appropriate spot.
    * Exact minimum: simple is the root
    * Remove minimum: remove top and swap with last element(bottommost rightmost element) and swap down the element untile the min-heap
      property is restored.
-Trie/s(Prefix trees): n-ary tree in which characters are stored at each node. Each path down the tree may rapresent a word, * on leaf 
                       indicate complete word.
                       Check if a string is a valid prefix cost O(K) like hashtable(usually we state that cost of hashtable is O(1) but actually
                       we pay the cost of "key" analysis to generate hashcode)

-Graph(116): simply collection of nodes with edges between(some of) them.
    * Can be either directed or undirected. Directed are one-way, undirected are two-way
    * Might consist of multiple isolted subgraphs
    * Graph can have cycles. An "acyclic graph" is a graph without cycles
-We can represent a graph in two common way:
    * Adjacency list: every vertex(node) stores a list of adjacent vertices.
    * Adjacency matrices: the edge are stored in a NxN matrix, graph algorithms used in adjacency(breadth first search) can be performed
      also with adjacency matrices but is less efficient because we need to iterate throught all nodes to identify node's neighbors

Graph Search(118)
-Depth-first search(DFS): we start at the root(or another node) and explore EVERY BRANCH COMPLETELY before move to next branch
-Breadth-first search(BFS): we start at the root(or another node) and explore NEIGHBOR before go to children
    * better for shortest path between two node(we stay close as possible to starting node)
-Bidirectional Search: used to find shortest path between a source and destination
